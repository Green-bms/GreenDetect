# GreenDetect
Opensource Wireless Sensor Network Platform (WSN) , for enviromental monitoring

## Description

![alt-text](https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3430841656175470749.jpg)
Green Detect project was created with the aim of providing the community with a tool to monitor and control the environment.
The Green Detect network is independent of the Internet, so it can work even in geographic areas where the Internet is not present.
In the Green Detect local network it is possible to connect from 1 to 60 sensors that transmit their data via wireless through the ESP-NOW protocol to a computer where through the Green Detect application it is possible to monitor each individual sensor, detect alarm conditions, locate the sensors in an animated geographic map and record all acquisitions in order to collect all data for preventive and statistical purposes.
Each individual sensor module is powered by a supercapacitor (or Nimh batteries) charged by a solar panel.

Green Detect is Opensource: anyone can modify and improve the project, for example by adding new types of sensors.

## Open source Development applications
The project was created using the following Open source applications:
- **KiCad** : to design sensor module
- **Arduino IDE** : to design the code of sensor module (ESP8266)
- **Visual Studio** : to design WIndows application in C# language
- **TinkerCad** : to design sensors and solar panel case for 3D printer
